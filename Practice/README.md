# Scala

In order to get familiar with the scala syntax I programmed following algorithms:

- AABrier (A prediction with experts advise algorithm)

- Online covariance (including parallelisation approach)

- Online variance (including parallelisation approach)

- kalman filter in 1D (including parallelisation discription)

- Extended kalman filter example in 1D

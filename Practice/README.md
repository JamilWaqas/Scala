# Scala

In order to get familiar with the scala syntax I programmed following algorithms:

1)AABrier (A prediction with experts advise algorithm)

2)Online covariance (including parallelisation approach)

3)Online variance (including parallelisation approach)

4)kalman filter in 1D (including parallelisation discription)

5)Extended kalman filter example in 1D
